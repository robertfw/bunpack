# Bunpack üê∞

_Because I'm sick and tired of googling the args for unpacking things_

`bunpack` will extract whatever* you throw at it

_*as long as it's a `tar.gz`, `tar.bz2`, `tar.xz`, or `zip`_

## Usage

`bunpack <file> [<destination>]`

Bunpack will select the correct decompression tool to use and ensure that your 
unpacked files will be in their own directory, because if there's one thing more
annoying than having to google the tar command args again, it's unpacking dozens
of files into your current directory.

Without passing `<destination>`, `bunpack` will create a target directory based
on the filename.

## Dependencies

You must have `babashka` installed and available on your `$PATH`. You can get it
at https://github.com/babashka/babashka

`Bunpack` shells out to perform the actual work, so you should have the following 
command line tools installed:
* `tar`
* `xz`
* `unzip`

## Installation

Get `bunpack.clj` somewhere on your `$PATH`. I would recommend cloning the 
repository and creating a link but whatever floats your boat.

## Contributing

PRs welcome! Please update tests if adding a new unpacker.
